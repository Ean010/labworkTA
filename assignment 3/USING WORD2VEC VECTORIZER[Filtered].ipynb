I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

I live in Illinois just outside of Chicago\\nand pay $1560 a year with full coverage at State Farm.  I did get a small\\ndiscount because of my alarm system($30 a year).

I don\\'t have\\none of the performance cars you listed, but if your record is\\nclean, then you should not be paying over $2K.\\n \\nDid you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find?\\nAlthough rates are supposed to be standardized, I\\'ve found that\\nmost places I initially call, give me some ridiculously high\\nquote and *finaly*, I hit one that is much lower.\\n \\nAlso, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at\\nrenewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a low\\nrate.  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance\\ncompanies 8^).', '\\nIt depends on your priorities.  A lot of people put higher priorities\\non gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying \"unsafe\" econoboxes\\ninstead of Volvos.  I personally take a middle ground -- the only\\nthing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.\\nI figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren\\'t common enough\\nfor me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are\\nlots of low-speed collisions that do worry me.', 'an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to\\n\"sport\" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets\\nthe switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does \"sport\"\\nmode entail?  several things:\\n\\n1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)\\n\\n2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\\n\\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\\n\\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there\\'s\\n\\tanother curve approaching)\\n\\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\\n\\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\\n\\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\\n\\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\\n\\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\\n\\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\\n\\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\\n5 speed)?  \\n\\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i\\'m sure there will\\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\\n', ': Ford and his automobile.  I need information on whether Ford is\\n: partially responsible for all of the car accidents and the depletion of\\n: the ozone layer.  Also, any other additional information will be greatly\\n: appreciated.  Thanks. \\n: \\nSSSSSoooooooooooo!!!!! Its all HIS fault!!

drivers who couldn't see stop signs or were fiddling with their radios and i have had three moving violations in the last 18 months one for going 85 in a 55 one for failure to clear an intersection i still say the damn light was yellow and one for going 35 in a 25 which didn't go on my record my rates from state farm with a passive restraint deduction on liability 500 deductible comprehensive and 500 deductible collision are roughly 1300 year i was paying just over 1100 year for a '92 escort lx james james p callison microcomputer coordinator u of oklahoma law center callison uokmax ecn uoknor edu callison aardvark ucs uoknor edu disclaimer i'm not an engineer but i play one at work the forecast calls for thunder '89 t bird sc it's a hell of a thing killing a man you take away all he has and all he's ever gonna have will munny unforgiven 61 i am beyond the under 25 age group but i have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you i owned a 1985 toyota celica gt i decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche 924 1987 model years i narrowed it down to those two i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924 i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924 but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the '85 celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer our lower risk division will continue to handle your account if you buy the porsche 924 we'll have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a 944 it's another story again we'll cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the 924 and the 924 is actually faster than the standard 944 that doens't make sense that's what the book says we don't insure corvettes either for some reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough high pressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft everyone's entitled to my opinion goldberg oasys dt navy mil imagination is more important than knowledge albert einstein 32 i live in idaho when i was 26 many years ago 10 years i bought a trans am new insurance was about 1300 year when i turned 26 it immediately dropped to 460 year i had not had any accidents before or after this was strictly an age change that same rate stayed pretty much the same until i sold the car 2 years ago my f 150 pickup is about 80 year less the real amazing thing is that when i woke up at age 25 i felt so much more responsible than i was before wes 21 for your information california male single under 25 no

thing that makes a huge difference in mass is the town you live in i'm personally in one of the best towns within reasonable distance of boston if i moved to the absolute best it would go down to about 1150 if i moved to the worst it would be 2000 also one accident and a couple of tickets would probably add another 600 rv 43 i have a 1990 mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd am 23 years old and have no tickets that went on my record i live in illinois just outside of chicago and pay 1560 a year with full coverage at state farm i did get a small discount because of my alarm system 30 a year i only live 15 miles from chicago but if i actually lived in the city the price would be about 2000 a year 41 i'm over 25 but in case you're interested anyway i'm insuring a 93 sho for 287 6 month thats 100k personal 300k total 100k property with 250 deductible glass and towing state farm 39 unless you are under 20 or have been driving for less than 5 years i think you are being seriously ripped off i don't have one of the performance cars you listed but if your record is clean then you should not be paying over 2k did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find although rates are supposed to be standardized i've found that most places i initially call give me some ridiculously high quote and finaly i hit one that is much lower also i have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at renewal no accidents tickets car gets older to maintain a low rate you always have to be careful when it comes to insurance companies 8\n",
      "3: it depends on your priorities a lot of people put higher priorities on gas mileage and cost than on safety buying unsafe econoboxes instead of volvos i personally take a middle ground the only thing i really look for is a three point seatbelt and 5 mph bumpers i figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there are lots of low speed collisions that do worry me\n",
      "4: an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy it switches to sport mode when the electronics figure it not when the driver sets the switch which is the proper way to do it imo so what does sport mode entail several things 1 revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy 2 delayed upshifts i e if you lift off briefly it will remain in the low gear this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's another curve approaching 3 part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal is depressed rather than the position of the pedal modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55 65 in 4th gear of a 5 speed how many of people who drive manuals really know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation i'm sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario ratio combinations stored in rom is likely to do better i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout high gear low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear high revs and small throttle opening the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight\n",
      "5: ford and his automobile i need information on whether ford is partially responsible for all of the car accidents and the depletion of the ozone layer also any other additional information will be greatly appreciated thanks sssssoooooooooooo its all his fault thank god louis chevrolet is innocent and that guy diesel he otto feel guilty\n",
      "6: yo watch the attributions i didn't say that again this isn't an appropriate forum for discussions on whether you should shoot someone for property damage vandalism theft but every responsible gun owner realizes that there are limits and the punishment must fit the crime i mean think about it is a really harmless prank worth killing over as i said the situation described punks setting off alarms and taunting people to come out could turn very ugly very quickly and it is worth being prepared when your life is potentially on the line james\n",
      "7: you can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in place of the bolt i have one on both of my cars there have been no leaks in 210 000 miles combined miles on both cars\n",
      "8: i have a 1986 acura integra 5 speed with 95 000 miles on it it is positively the worst car i have ever owned i had an 83 prelude that had 160k miles on it when i sold it and it was still going strong this is with religious attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc both cars were driven in exactly the same manner 1 it has gone through two clutches which are underrated 2 3 sets of tires really eats tires in the front even with careful align 3 all struts started leaking about 25 30k miles 4 windshield wiper motor burned up service note on this one 5 seek stop working on radio about 20k miles 6 two timing belts 7 constant error signals from computer 8 and finally a rod bearing went out on the no 1 piston seriously damaging the crankshaft contaminating the engine etc when the overhaul was done last week it required new crankshaft one new cam shaft has two because the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it the camshaft took 4 weeks to get because it is on national back order everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year they went to a new design in 87 parts are very expensive\n",
      "9: assuming yours is a non turbo mr2 the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline 4 that doesn't have balance shafts i guess toyota didn't care about little details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or recommendation which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no balance shafts it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a v6\n",
      "10: in addition to restricted mileage many classic insurance carriers also require that the vehicle be garaged when not in use 0 02 ericy\n",
      "11: several years ago gm was having trouble with the rings sticking on the 5 7 diesel they traced a cause to the use of 10w 40 oil they would not honor warranty work if 10w 40 was used if my memory serves me 5 30 10 30 or 20 50 was ok'd though\n",
      "12: i had the same problem in my '90 mx 6 luckily i had it fixed under warranty i think they replaced a tail light gasket check with a dealer it's a known problem\n",
      "13: as an additional data point i have run castrol 20w50 exclusively in the following cars 75 rabbit 78 scirocco 76 rabbit 78 bus 70 beetle 76 bus 86 jetta gli i've never had an oil related problem disclaimer it gets mighty hot down here\n",
      "14: women's pants rarely have pockets and most when they do are too shallow to use i is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when she goes from building to a car it is protect herself from would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who as a definite place of safty ie a locked car puting keys and walet looks ugly it breaks the lines and makes you rear look wide as a cows also to have the habits that work for any clothing situation the pruse functions no mater what you are wearing even nude or a bikni a women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets 2 on the outside none on the inside i have men's coats that have as much as 6 pockets this is definitally not fair as one that wears both men's and women's clothes i can tell you women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets when dressed as a man i put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and my keys in a coat outside pocket it is much more covenent than the pants pockets and looks better having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is paramout to a woman's safty men don't see this as a problem a woman is aware of this every time she goes out i e image some red necks yelling at you we are going to fuck you and the out weight you by 20 lbs and have 3 inches in hight on you if you want to find out why a women does something live as one\n",
      "15: i agree six hour long stretches behind the wheel really make me thirsty especially for something with caffeine i consider it a failing of my car that it has no cup holder nor anywhere to put a cup holder\n",
      "16: from thwang mentor cc purdue edu tommy hwang subject advise needed in buying automobile i am in search of a dependable automobile to purchase below are its requirements 5 v6 or above most of the cars you mentioned are below smaller than v6 engine tony\n",
