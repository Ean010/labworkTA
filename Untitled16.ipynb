Bun is soft, patty crispy and still juicy, great flavours overall. The Philly cheesesteak was also good with very generous portion. Pizzas also were very generous with the toppings and cheesy. Milkshake was also thick not watery like some other places.\\nAunty MM running the place was super friendly and accommodating. Parking is also plentiful which makes it's a super plus point.\\nFood: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Atmosphere: 4/5   \n",

      "2     I Will Always Love You by Bon Jovi was playing from the speakers as I pushed the door open to enter Mean Mince, an American concept restaurant serving burgers, sandwiches, milkshakes and other dishes in Mutiara Damansara.\\n\\nChef Min who studied in culinary and has working experience locally and abroad, has decided to open up Mean Mince to serve hearty food to the meat-loving people. His creation, deep fried burger, has beaten the likes of MyBurgerLab and Define:Burger during My Town Burger Fest in 2019 - the very reason of this visit.\\n\\nMM Deep Fried Burger RM23.90 - Snugly wrapped in special bread dough is a 125g Mean Minces patty with a choice of either beef or chicken, nestled with caramelised onions, and topped off with a healthy helping of melty mozzarella cheese. The patty was so good and juicy that the jus spilled out with each bite. Excellent stuff!\\nPatty Melts RM27.90 - the sandwich bread was grilled with cheese; in-house chicken (or beef) served with pickled onions and tomato salsa. The grilled cheese added a good savory touch to this chicken sandwich.\\nChilli Cheese Fries RM18.90 - served on stainless steel platter are a bed of fries topped with Bolognese style chicken and melted cheese. A hit with the young ones and I couldnt resist taking some.\\nJalapeno Poppers RM17.90 - Breaded jalapeno peppers stuffed with spicy cream cheese. For about RM3 a piece, it was on pricey side.. I made better version.\\nMM SliderS RM23.90 - 3x 40g in-house beef patty in baby buns & melted\\nwith american slice cheese, topped with pickled red onions, caramelised onions, and mustard mayo. Easy for the kids to grab.\\nPeanut Butter Milkshake RM15.00 - cant get more American with this classic milkshake. I liked this...\\n\\nFor burger lovers, the Deep Fried Burger alone could warrant a trip to Mean Mince.\\n\\nThe members in the family are eyeing the Chicago-style deep dish pizza, as well as other variations of the burgers on subsequent visits.\\nFood: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Atmosphere: 4/5\\n\\nRecommended dishes\\nChilli Cheese Fries   \n",

Good quality meat with fluffy brioche buns. Onion rings were also made with actual proper onions and not process packed ones. I really enjoyed the smash burger and will definitely be back to try the Philly cheesesteak.\\nFood: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Atmosphere: 4/5   \n",

I especially like how they cooked the cheese on the burger. What made it my go-to burger place is that I can choose to have my burger without a bun and wrapped in lettuce, instead.\\n\\nA must-try for those who loves pork burgers!   \n",

So was the second time.\\n\\nNow they have open an outlet in SS15 Subang Jaya. Although not in KL itself, but close enough.\\n\\nStaff are friendly and helpful. Did a takeaway this time as this place isn't easy to look for parking.\\n\\nOrdered their signature and biggest burger called Burger of Steel, 1/2 dozen porkets, and 1/2 dozen fried bacon strips.\\n\\nIt was lunch time and there were customers dining in. The porkets were actually pork nuggets. \\n\\nAll the items on the order were really good. Will come back again for sure   \n",

While checking the huge menu on the wall a guy came over to the cashier and stare at us with a rude facial expression. When we order our burgers he sounded really unhappy as in seriously unhappy we came in at such late hours. \\n\\nWe order what we wanted and he rudely ask us “what combo you want?” With the mouth covered with a black mask. So it was really hard to understand what he was saying. So I asked him to repeat what he was saying and Again he rudely ask “WHAT COMBO YOU ALL WANT?” Not wanting to piss him off any more we just order all same. “All same. Pork is fine!” I said. Then he ask us another question about the combo pointing at the TV menu and again with a rally rude tone. \\n\\n1st of all it’s freaking hard to hear when his mouth is covered with a black mask. \\n2nd it’s so hard to understand his English especially when he sounded so angry. \\n3rd. If it’s about to close and we are disturbing your closing time, just tel us it’s closed so we won’t be tortured by the staff rudeness. We r not eating here for free. We didn’t ask for anything for free. \\n\\nWe understand rude customers as we are also in the retail business BUT the funny thing is we were NOT even rude. We were so worry to even upset him. We cannot handle anymore customer then put up the closed sign.   \n",

It works like fast food joint which you order,paid and wait for your foods. Place is clean and service if friendly \\nWe ordered the Beef/Chicken burgers,but was surprised that the burger didn't come with any fries. Fries need to buy separately. We find the burger is tasty, coney sauce is delicious. The sides also compliment the burgers. Patties are cooked well,chicken has that crisp outer. pretty enjoyable burger if you don't mind to pay extra for fries.   \n",
